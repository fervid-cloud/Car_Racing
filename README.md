# Welcome to the Racing Game

## Project Introduction

This web application is a car racing game which has been made with combination of front-end using html, css and vanilla javascript and back-end using typescript, Nodejs.

The game mechanics are this: you select a player and track, the game begins and you accelerate your racer by clicking an acceleration button. As you accelerate so do the other players and the Race UI live-updates as players change position on the track. The final view is a results page displaying the players' rankings.

The game has three main views:

1. The form to create a race

2. The race progress view (this includes the live-updating Race UI and acceleration button)

3. The race results view
